# Project 1 - Tipster

**Tipster** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Sabrina Meng**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
      ** Note: This feature works fine on my phone and also worked in the emulator (but for some reason it only works sometimes in the emulator)
      
The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Calculates bill split across different numbers of people
- [X] Remembers custom tip amount and sets slider bar to where user last set it when the settings page is opened

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories (on phone followed by emulator):

## Notes

I think the most challenging part of creating this app was setting up the new settings page and figuring out how to remember data across different views and
launches. Styling the UI took quite a bit of time as well (just lots of experimentation with designs, symbols, layouts, colors, effects, etc.)!
